# Active Context - engineering-memory-bank

## Current Session State

**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Primary Task**: Memory bank system setup for engineering memory bank development context

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Memory Bank System Setup
- Setting up development context management for memory bank development workflows
- Establishing decision tracking for memory bank architecture and AI integration
- Creating foundation for PRD-driven memory bank feature development

### 2. Memory Bank Development Context
- **Key Patterns**: Decision capture, AI analysis, git integration, knowledge management
- **Current Architecture**: Python library with git hooks and AI analysis
- **Focus**: Engineering decision documentation and cross-project knowledge sharing

## Active Development Areas

### Core Library (Python)
- **Status**: Basic decision capture framework with git integration
- **Location**: `python/memory_bank/`
- **Key Files**:
  - `core/memory_bank.py` - Main MemoryBank class
  - `git/integration.py` - Git hook integration
  - `ai/analyzer.py` - AI-powered decision analysis

### Decision Management
- **Status**: Template-driven decision documentation
- **Features**: Structured decision capture, analysis, and retrieval
- **Templates**: Engineering-specific documentation formats

### AI Integration
- **Status**: Framework for AI-powered decision analysis
- **Capabilities**: Pattern recognition, insight generation, knowledge synthesis

## Key Files & Locations

### Core Implementation
- `python/memory_bank/core/`: Core memory bank logic and decision management
- `python/memory_bank/git/`: Git integration and automatic capture
- `python/memory_bank/ai/`: AI analysis and insight generation
- `python/memory_bank/templates/`: Engineering decision documentation templates

### Integration Points
- Git hooks for automatic decision capture
- Template system for consistent documentation
- AI analysis for pattern recognition and insights

## Session Goals

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**: Initialize tracking files for memory bank development
2. **Establish Memory Bank Development Patterns**: Document decision capture and AI integration strategies
3. **Create PRD Framework**: Template for memory bank feature development
4. **Prepare for Next Development**: Enhanced AI analysis and cross-project knowledge features
