## Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Git Hook Integration for Automatic Capture
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Status**: Implemented  

**Context**: Need for seamless decision capture without disrupting engineering workflows.

**Decision**: Integrate with git hooks to automatically capture decision context from commits.

**Rationale**:
- Engineers already use git for code management
- Commit messages contain decision context
- Automatic capture ensures consistency
- No additional workflow burden

**Implementation**:
- Git post-commit hooks analyze commit messages and changes
- Decision extraction from commit context and file modifications
- Automatic population of decision templates
- Integration with existing engineering git workflows

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Seamless decision capture without workflow changes
- ✅ Consistent documentation across all commits
- ✅ Rich context from code changes and commit messages
- ⚠️ Depends on quality of commit messages

### ADR-002: AI-Powered Decision Analysis
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Large volume of engineering decisions need analysis and pattern recognition.

**Decision**: Implement AI analysis engine for decision pattern recognition and insights.

**Rationale**:
- Human analysis doesn't scale to large decision volumes
- AI can identify patterns humans miss
- Automated insights improve decision quality over time
- Machine learning enhances knowledge management

**Implementation**:
- Integration with Claude/OpenAI APIs for decision analysis
- Pattern recognition algorithms for decision classification
- Insight generation for cross-project knowledge
- Automated recommendation system for similar decisions

### ADR-003: Template-Driven Documentation
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Engineering decisions need consistent, structured documentation.

**Decision**: Use template system for consistent decision documentation format.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent format improves readability and analysis
- Templates ensure comprehensive decision capture
- Structured data enables automated processing
- Professional presentation for engineering review

**Templates**:
- Decision records with context, rationale, alternatives
- Timeline tracking with milestones and deadlines
- Issue documentation with root cause analysis
- Fabrication tracking with vendor and delivery information

### ADR-004: Cross-Project Knowledge Sharing
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Status**: Planned

**Context**: Engineering teams benefit from learning across different projects.

**Decision**: Implement cross-project insight generation and knowledge sharing.

**Rationale**:
- Design patterns repeat across projects
- Component choices benefit from historical analysis
- Failure modes and solutions are transferable
- Team learning accelerates with shared knowledge

**Planned Implementation**:
- Decision pattern analysis across multiple projects
- Component choice recommendations based on historical data
- Failure mode databases with mitigation strategies
- Cross-project insight dashboards

### ADR-005: Memory Bank Meta-Development
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Memory bank development itself needs context management.

**Decision**: Use memory bank system for developing the memory bank system (meta-approach).

**Rationale**:
- Dogfooding ensures system usability
- Memory bank development benefits from decision tracking
- Meta-approach validates system effectiveness
- Continuous improvement through self-application

**Implementation**:
- Memory bank tracking for memory bank development decisions
- ADR format for memory bank architectural choices
- Progress tracking for memory bank feature development
- Context management for memory bank enhancement work
